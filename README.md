# Cobol testing
> Sometimes you just cannot stop to think if you should if you totally could

This is just my personal project for testing out and learning COBOL

## Getting started

To run this project, make sure you have `yarn` and `docker` installed and run:

```shell
yarn # installs dev dependencies
yarn watch # starts a development build pipeline
```

This starts watching you .cob files at `src/` folder and compiles the source
files to `public/` folder when there are any changes to those files.

It also starts a development server to port `$PORT` or 5000

## Why?

Why not?

Also:
* COBOL is an interesting language
* You don't need to buy expensive IBM hard-/software anymore to run it
* This is just my personal hobby learning project, so don't expect much from the
  actual code
